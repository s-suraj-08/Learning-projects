This is the first of many simple projects which I will take up to get a better grasp of programming in python.\
<br>Purpose of the project:<br />
    -To learn, Basic usage of Python's csv,os, argparse modules\
              -Get a simple grip of coding in python\
    -To be able to perform simple automation tasks such as file search using Python\

Python program which takes folder name(or search string in the form regular expression) and outputs a csv file which contains the File location/s. \
The input is to be passed as arguments while running the program.\
Input arguments:\
                *Input folder search location
                *File name/pattern to be searched
                *Csv file location for output
Output is a csv file which contains the file locations matching the filename or the pattern.\
(Note: The program was written on a windows machine, might not be as compatible in other OS)
