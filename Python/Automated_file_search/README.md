        This is the first of many simple projects which I will take up to get a better grasp of programming in python.\
        Purpose of the project:
        <ul>
        <li>To learn, Basic usage of Python's csv,os, argparse modules
        <li>Get a simple grip of coding in python
        <li>To be able to perform simple automation tasks such as file search using Python
        <ul \>
        Python program which takes folder name(or search string in the form regular expression) and outputs a csv file which contains the File location/s.
        The input is to be passed as arguments while running the program.
        Input arguments:
                *Input folder search location
                *File name/pattern to be searched
                *Csv file location for output
        Output is a csv file which contains the file locations matching the filename or the pattern.
        (Note: The program was written on a windows machine, might not be as compatible in other OS)
