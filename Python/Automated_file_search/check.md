 <p>This is the first of many simple projects which I will take up to get a better grasp of programming in python.<br>
  Purpose of the project:<p \>
 <ul>
  <li>To learn, Basic usage of Python's csv,os, argparse modules</li>
  <li>Get a simple grip of coding in python</li>
  <li>To be able to perform simple automation tasks such as file search using Python</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Python program which takes folder name(or search string in the form regular expression) and outputs a csv file which contains the File location/s.<br>
