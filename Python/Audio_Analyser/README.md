  <p>Purpose of the project:
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to perform Signal Processing using Python, the first step is to visualise the audio waveform</li>
      <li>Build a simple GUI, which plays the audio file and also shows the corrsponding waveform in both time & frequency domain, i.e The Fourier 
        Trasnsform of the audio file</li>
      <li>The GUI to have pause and resume options, this should pause/resume both the audio output and the corresponding waveform</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is to that visualisation along with the audio output helps in recogninsing the waveform where the noise occurs. The corresponding FT waveform 
    to help build a filter to reduce the noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Program takes in argument of wave file location and a GUI will be run which displays the waveform and FT of the corresposnding audio.
    Ex command: audio_analyser.py -i "E:/../100hz.wav"
